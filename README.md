# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
Introduction:
A brain stroke occurs when something blocks the blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or dead. Globally, one in four people over age 25 will have a stroke in their lifetime. A machine learning-based brain stroke prediction would effectively prevent brain stroke-related death. Machine learning techniques are used to identify, classify, and predict strokes based on medical data. A pre-stroke checkup is very expensive, and existing research is limited in predicting risk factors for various types of strokes due to a lack of data. To address this limitation, a machine learning-based brain stroke prediction is proposed by using an improvised machine learning model for analyzing the levels of risk obtained within. 



Problem Statement:

The majority of the medical database is made up of discrete data, making decision-making utilizing it a challenging endeavor. Data mining subfields of machine learning (ML) and deep learning are adept at handling huge, well-organized datasets. Because of this, it will be an excellent tool for the identification, detection, and prognosis of numerous illnesses. The major objective of our project is to develop a machine learning-based brain stroke prediction system by examining the degrees of risk associated with strokes using advanced machine learning models.

Deployment Platforms:
Once the model is ready for production, it can be deployed on cloud platforms, edge devices, or web servers, depending on the specific requirements .

In Depth Analysis:

Dataset:
 A high-quality dataset is essential for training and evaluating the machine learning model. It should contain relevant features (e.g., age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, BMI, etc.) and a target variable (e.g., stroke: 0 or 1) that represents the outcome to be predicted.

Data Preprocessing:
 Data preprocessing involves various steps, including handling missing values, handling outliers, feature scaling, and data normalization. These steps ensure the data is in a suitable format for training the machine learning model.

Feature Selection:
 Selecting the most relevant features from the dataset can improve model performance and reduce computational complexity. It involves identifying and keeping the features that have the most impact on the target variable while eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.

Data Split:
 Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets is crucial to evaluate the performance of the model. Typically, the data is randomly divided into a training set (used for model training) and a testing set (used for model evaluation).

Model Selection: 
Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model is crucial for accurate predictions. In the case of brain stroke prediction, algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks can be considered based on the characteristics of the dataset and the desired performance.

Model Training: 
The selected model is trained using the training dataset. The model learns patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable to make predictions.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) are calculated to assess the model's predictive ability.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
 Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the chosen model can significantly impact its performance. Techniques like cross-validation or grid search can be employed to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.

Performance Visualization: 
Visualizing the model's performance through various techniques, such as confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, ROC curves, or calibration curves, can provide a clear understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.

Model Deployment:
 Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed in a production environment to make predictions on new, unseen data.
